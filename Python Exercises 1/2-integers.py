# We all know that Python can do many different things with numbers, let's take a look!

# Make sure you double check your code before hitting run! I might have snuck in my some syntax errors!

# Addition

print(100 + 100)

print("100" + "100")

# What happened above? Take a hard look at the code and think of the differences in each line, why did the second line not output 200?


# Subtractions

print(30 - 1203432)

# Multiplication

print(30423 * "46")

print("hello Wemmy!" * 339)

# Division

print(100 / 10)

print('39' / 3)
